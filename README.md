## Description
This project is a single-page application using React.js to dynamically render content to create a portfolio that includes "About me", "Contact me", "Resume", and "Portfolio" pages.

This portfolio was created to display my work and web applications. Heres hoping it impresses a potential employer to see whether or not I am a good match for their company.
